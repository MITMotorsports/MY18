# MY18
This repository contains all the code that physically runs on MY18.
External libraries are imported via submodules and found under the [`lib`](lib) directory.

Development environment and toolchain installation scripts are also provided.

# Development Environment
On MY18, we are standardizing the build and flash toolchain for all embedded
devices on the car.
To be compliant with the standard, you will need a Linux OS to compile and
flash code from.

## Native
On Ubuntu or Ubuntu Bash on Windows 10, you can run the included
set up scripts, that will fetch the toolchain using `apt` and `git`.
Run the [`toolchain/all.sh`](toolchain/all.sh) script to set up the toolchain.

Although discouraged, check [here](https://github.com/MITMotorsports/MY18/wiki/Installing-the-toolchain-on-Windows) for Windows installation instructions, if Ubuntu Bash on Windows 10 is not an option. Be aware that free upgrades to Windows 10 Pro are available to MIT students through [here](https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx?ws=33ef38ee-a79b-e011-969d-0030487d8897&vsro=8).

## Docker
